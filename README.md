# FiveM_CasaBlanca_RP
CasaBlanca Roleplay  When you hop on to any game, you are probably doing playing to have fun. Well what if we want to play something more complicated than Call of Duty?  My partners and I aim to create a Moroccan community that is laid back, relaxing, and engaging.  We are a 32 slot server based in the morocco that (obviously) runs ESX.  We currently have some custom vehicles and scripts on the server.  RP FEATURES 1.    Local governments (I.E. Elected Mayors and Sheriffs) 2.    Registerable businesses: You apply on discord a unique tracking number where you can be recognized by local governments. For example you might want to register a security company so your employees can be authorized to carry ARs legally. Basically you register a business if you need special permissions to do something that an average citizen is not allowed to do. 3.    Gangs: gangs with a certain amount of members and IG money could ask for a discord tag to be official 4.    Areas of Jurisdiction: Different Police agencies have set areas of operation  We plan to includeâ€¦ 1.    Custom Housing 2.    A black market hub where players can sell illegal items safely 3.    More custom cars 4.    (POSSIBLY) National Guard, only if gangs get too out of hand Check us out; we are in need of Police Chiefs, EMS and such join our Discord @https://discord.gg/KpfXTQf
